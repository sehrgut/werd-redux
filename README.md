# werd-redux

werd-redux is an excessively-complex rewrite of Christopher
Pound's simple conlang word generator, [werd][1].

Initially conceived to enable me to extend the syntax of the
werd ruleset to include verbose rulenames and explicit
weights, it's become something of a lex/yacc learning project.
